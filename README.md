# RAG Chatbot with LangChain

This project is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot** built using the **LangChain** framework. It combines the generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with a retrieval system to deliver accurate, context-aware, and knowledge-grounded responses.

## 🚀 Features

- **Conversational Abilities**  
  Engages in natural, multi-turn conversations while maintaining context.

- **Knowledge Retrieval**  
  Retrieves relevant information from an external knowledge base to ensure responses are factual and grounded.

- **Prompt Engineering**  
  Uses carefully designed prompts to optimize the quality and relevance of the model’s outputs.

- **Semantic Search**  
  Leverages embeddings and vector stores for efficient semantic search, retrieving documents based on meaning rather than exact keywords.
