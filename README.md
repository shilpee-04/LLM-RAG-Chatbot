#RAG Chatbot with LangChain
This project is a sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot built using the powerful LangChain framework. It is designed to handle complex conversational and retrieval-based tasks by combining the generative power of large language models (LLMs) with a robust data retrieval system.

Features
Conversational Abilities: The chatbot can engage in natural, multi-turn conversations while maintaining context.

Knowledge Retrieval: It intelligently retrieves relevant information from an external knowledge base to provide accurate and grounded responses.

Prompt Engineering: Utilizes prompt engineering techniques to optimize the performance and relevance of the LLM's output.

Semantic Search: Employs embeddings and vector stores for efficient semantic search, ensuring relevant documents are retrieved based on meaning, not just keywords.
